This lab looked at:
1. Find and download satellite imagery that is split up by band. Landsat is a great choice. Add the imagery to your Github.
2. Using the satellite imagery you downloaded, create a composite raster image
3. Find a digital elevation model of your area of interest and create the following: Shace-Shuttle Radar Topography Mission is a great choice. Add the DEM to your Github.
4. Creating A hillshade analysis raster and A slope analysis raster



You will find the python code file within this Lab 7 folder as well.
