Lab 6


This lab looked into:
1. Create a script that can generate a graduated color map
2. Turn said script into a toolbox that can be accessed from the Geoprocessing pane in ArcGIS Pro
3. Utilize a progressor inside the toolbox to inform the user how far along the script is in generating the map



You will find the python code file within this Lab 6 folder as well.
