**Introducing the Industry Problem:**



Since the 1800's, the number of wells, oil and gas wells, have exponentially increased throughout the country. As the country has gone through great change and rapid industrialization, there are so many companies with substantial amounts of data. With this is mind, a Master Well Database is the solution to organizing, centralizing, updating, and distributing data. A software tool can be built by utilizing ArcPy and Visual Studio Code to build this Master Well Database. As there are many companies, some of the databases that have their well locations include CAD, ArcGIS, Decision Space Geographics, Petrel, OpenWells, COMPASS, Drilling Info, HSI, and State Regulatory. The designing of the software tool is outlined below with examples of python codes of the most commonly used GIS tasks while creating a software tool like this.






**Creation of the Software Tool Outline:**



1. Where will the software development be done. Lab 1



2. You need to load several sets of data that represents the Well locations. Lab 3



3. Inverse coordinates of the different Well locations to determine if any agree or their accuracy. Lab 2



4. Write to Master Well Geodatabase. Lab 4



5. Build a buffer to determine if the Well(s) were put in NAD83 vs. NAD 27. Lab 5



6. Build a graduated color Wells to indicate confidence of Master Well location. Lab 6



7. Use aerial images to check Master Well DB. Lab 7






**Project Planning Discussion:**



1. Justify the Return on Investment (ROI)



2. Interface with Users



3. Gather requirements



4. Softwares, DBs, etc will be used



5. Code with usages of NumPy, SciPy, PySAL, Model Builder and/or ArcPy



6. Approach commenting, testing, status updates, and reporting



7. Deploy, maintain, and archive your software
