**Bhumika Purohit - GEOG 676: GIS Programming - GitHub ePortfolio**



**Introducing the Industry Problem:**



Since the 1800's, the number of wells, oil and gas wells, have exponentially increased throughout the country. As the country has gone through great change and rapid industrialization, there are so many companies with substantial amounts of data. With this is mind, a Master Well Database is the solution to organizing, centralizing, updating, and distributing data. A software tool can be built by utilizing ArcPy and Visual Studio Code to build this Master Well Database. As there are many companies, some of the databases that have their well locations include CAD, ArcGIS, Decision Space Geographics, Petrel, OpenWells, COMPASS, Drilling Info, HSI, and State Regulatory. The designing of the software tool is outlined below with examples of python codes of the most commonly used GIS tasks while creating a software tool like this.






**Creation of the Software Tool Outline:**



1. Where will the software development be done.



As stated earlier, the software tool will be built by utilizing ArcPy and Visual Studio Code. The structure and development of the codes within ArcPy and Visual Studio Code will be located in a GitHub repository. This GitHub repository is used to organize the project of creating the structure and development of the software tool. An example of a GitHub repository and it's structure: https://github.com/bhumika-purohit/purohit-geog676/






2. You need to load several sets of data that represents the Well locations. Lab 3



Loading several data sets, first, requires the need to read the files. This can be done through the use of code. The code can be written to read the data, parse through the data to ultimatily compile and organize the data. In the case of our industry problem of creating a Master Well Database, data sets need to be obtained from databases, including CAD, ArcGIS, Decision Space Geographics, Petrel, OpenWells, COMPASS, Drilling Info, HSI, and State Regulatory. Once these data sets have been read by the software tool, the tool can further the process the creation of the Master Well Database. An example of code that read data to find the areas of various shapes: https://github.com/bhumika-purohit/purohit-geog676/tree/main/Lab-3



3. Inverse coordinates of the different Well locations to determine if any agree or their accuracy. Lab 2



4. Write to Master Well Geodatabase. Lab 4



5. Build a buffer to determine if the Well(s) were put in NAD83 vs. NAD 27. Lab 5



6. Build a graduated color Wells to indicate confidence of Master Well location. Lab 6



7. Use aerial images to check Master Well DB. Lab 7






**Project Planning Discussion:**



1. Justify the Return on Investment (ROI)



2. Interface with Users



3. Gather requirements



4. Softwares, DBs, etc will be used



5. Code with usages of NumPy, SciPy, PySAL, Model Builder and/or ArcPy



6. Approach commenting, testing, status updates, and reporting



7. Deploy, maintain, and archive your software
